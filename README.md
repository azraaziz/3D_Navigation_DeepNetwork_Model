# 3D_Navigation_DeepNetwork_Model
This model is a stacked autoencoder deep neural network to model spatial cells in 3D environments. There are three environments taken into consideration: 1) Lattice mazes,
2) Helical maze, 4) Pegboard maze.
The model mimics the neuronal responses of the brain region (Hippocampus) responsible for helping us to understand 3D environment during navigation.
Model_U.ipny in 3D_NavigationModel is the main file in python.
firing_field_properties_main_U.m is to generate the results for lattice mazes. Similarly, firing_peg_helix_main_U.m file is for generating the results for helical 
and pegboard mazes.
